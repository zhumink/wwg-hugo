Amongst the many techniques suggested by Dr Schein were the following...
<!--more--> 

1. physically remove the prisoner to an area sufficiently isolated in order to break or seriously weaken close emotional ties;
2. segregate all natural leaders;
3. prohibit group activities that do not fit brainwashing objectives;
4. systematic withholding of mail;
5. create a feeling amongst the isolated group of prisoners that they
have been abandoned by and totally isolated from the community;
6. undermine all emotional supports;
7. preclude access to literature which does not aid in the brainwashing
process.
